Observation
•	Refunded sales were adding to total of related cost. Transformed the data set to be more accurate
•	Date was in decimal format
•	There were few blank rows of data which I removed for more accurate results
•	Fido is $130 cheaper than Rogers


Opportunity
•	Mitigation of refunds. For all the sales performed. 3.7% are being refunded or exchanged. 
•	Small business plans have a higher ROI. We should take time to train staff on presenting business options to industry professional who might have their own registered business i.e. accountant, contractors, lawyers, plumbers, electricians etc
•	Multiple lines/add a line
•	Utilizing high profit devices such as iphone SE, older blackberry devices/clearance devices
